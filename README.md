# 🫁 Lung Nodule Classification: Benign vs Malignant

## 📌 Overview  
This project classifies lung nodules (benign or malignant) using medical imaging CT data and deep learning techniques. The goal is to assist in early detection of lung cancer by aiding radiologists in the classification process.

## 🧪 What It Does  
- **Preprocessing:** Extracts nodule patches from CT scans
- **Modeling:** Utilizes 3D deep convolutional networks
- **Evaluation:** Measures model performance using metrics like **Acuracy** and **FROC curves** on held-out data, and understands where the module is focusing using **Grad-CAMs**.

## 🧠 Technologies Used  
- 🧬 Deep Learning with pytorch (3D CNNs)

## 📊 Key Results

## 🔭 Future Directions
- Expand to incorporate nodule detection (not just classification)
- Test alternative architectures
- Explore explainability techniques and visual heatmaps
